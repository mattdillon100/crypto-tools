# Wildcard's Crypto Tools

This is just a gathering place for any scripts I find helpful to create as I navigate the world of blockchain.

These are all open source with a "Do what you want with them but don't cause harm" licence, whichever one that is.

Each are in their own directories with their own readme.

### Side note

The scripts in here are based on usage for BSC (Binance Smart Chain) coins/tokens. Some may be adaptable for other
chains, I'm not sure. I will try to keep documentation up to date as I find out.
